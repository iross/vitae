In terms of size and scope of data analysis, there are few things
that compare to the output of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Discovering the
Higgs boson was a bona fide needle-in-a-haystack search, ultimately leading to
one of the most important needles ever found. As a member of the Compact Muon
Solenoid team searching for the particle through an highly efficient (but
statistically rare) signature, I have run a complete analysis chain, combing
roughly two dozen Higgs boson candidates out of the billions and billions of raw
physics events.

It is this experience, along with my insatiable appetite for learning new
technologies that make me an ideal candidate for the Systems Integration
Developer position at the UW Center for High Throughput Computing. Along the
path to my PhD in high energy particle physics, I learned not only how large
scale computing operations work, but also how they can fail and how to build
tools to support them.  In a fast-paced, results-driven world, it's critical to
quickly identify problems, find their root cause, and patch them as quickly as
possible.  From unexpected surprises in control plots to late-night hardware
failures to broken code, I've seen and dealt with a wide variety of problems,
successfully (and rewardingly) dealing with each one.

In addition to my problem-solving and Big Data experiences, I also have
an innate love for learning new technologies. I've taught myself
MATLAB, C++, and python through my career path, while also pursuing Ruby, R, Storm,
machine learning, and myriad other topics at the hobby level.  Learning
technologies is a passion of mine, not only in understanding the tools
themselves but also in thinking about (and implementing) ways to use them.

Upon receiving my PhD in August of 2013, I accepted a Technical Services
position at Epic, the near-ubiquitous electronic medical record software company
here in Madison. 
In my time there, I've provided
support for six healthcare organizations, helping them maintain, build, and
configure software suites which give hundreds of thousands of patients ready access
to their personal health record. While I've enjoyed both the challenge of
learning a new system and the satisfaction in providing support, I feel as
though the technology stack and amount of software development are not aligned
with my personal ambitions. I simply want to spend more time developing in, and
working with, more flexible tools and languages.

I would love to bring my unique blend of problem solving experience,
technological affinity, and passion for helping others to the Center for High
Throughput Computing. The size, scope, and nature of your work are aligned not
only with my skills, but also my personality. I'd love nothing more than to talk
to you further about the position. I'm reachable by email
(ian.ackerman.ross@gmail.com) or via phone (608.561.1729). I look forward to
talking to you soon!
