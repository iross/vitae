In terms of size and scope of data analysis, there are few things
that compare to the output of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Discovering the
Higgs boson was a bona fide needle-in-a-haystack search, ultimately leading to
one of the most important needles ever found. As a member of the Compact Muon
Solenoid team searching for the particle in an highly efficient (but
statistically rare) final state, I have run a complete analysis chain, combing
roughly two dozen Higgs bosons out of the billions and billions of raw physics
events.

It is this experience, along with my insatiable appetite for learning new
technologies that make me an ideal candidate for the [x] position at [y]. Along
the path to my PhD in high energy particle physics (which will be complete in
August), I've learned not only how large scale analyses work, but also how they
can fail and (most importantly) how to build and support them.  In a fast-paced,
results-driven world, it's critical to quickly identify problems, find their
root cause, and patch them as quickly as possible.  From unexpected surprises in
control plots to late-night hardware failures to broken code, I've seen and
dealt with a wide variety of problems, successfully (and rewardingly) dealing
with each one.

In addition to the problem-solving and Big Data experience I have, I also have
an innate love for learning new technologies. In addition to teaching myself
MATLAB, C++, and python through my career, I've learned some Ruby, R, and
machine learning at the hobby level. Intrigued by the breadth of tools provided
by Amazon Web Services, I've created a few micro instances, to see for myself
how it all works. While I've utilized hadoop in my analyses, I was recently
introduced to Storm, and am currently using my evenings and weekends learning
more about it. Learning technologies is a passion of mine, not only in learning
the tools themselves but also in thinking about (and implementing) ways to use
them.

I would love to bring my unique blend of problem solving experience,
technological affinity, and passion for helping others to the [y]. The size,
scope, and nature of your work are aligned not only with my skills, but also my
personality. I'd love nothing more than to talk to you further about the
position. I'm reachable by email (ian.ackerman.ross@gmail.com) or via phone
(608.561.1729). I look forward to talking to you soon!
